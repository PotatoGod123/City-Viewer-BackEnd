# Back End Lab, City Viewer Lab-06-09

## Overview
This project will be using a pre built front end website to test out the functionality of the back-end side I am making. Using node and heroku to deploy and have a working server, the problem at hand is giving the front end part of the website information when calling the back end via ajax.



**Version**: 1.1.1
